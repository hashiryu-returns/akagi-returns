//! In-process broadcast buses connecting Akagi's subsystems.
//!
//! Five buses, all `tokio::sync::broadcast::Sender`-typed:
//!
//! - [`MjaiBus`]: every `MjaiEvent` parsed by a platform bridge is fanned
//!   out here. Producers: bridge → proxy handler. Consumers: `BotManager`,
//!   `ipc` forwarder, future HUD/storage/WS server.
//! - [`BotResponseBus`]: every `BotResponse` from the active `BotRunner`.
//!   Producer: `BotManager`. Consumers: `ipc` forwarder, future HUD /
//!   external WS / replay recorder.
//! - [`BotStatusBus`]: lifecycle of the active bot subprocess
//!   (`Idle/Loading/Ready/Error/Stopped`). Producer: `BotManager`.
//!   Consumer: `ipc` forwarder (UI loading spinner).
//! - [`CaptureStatusBus`]: lifecycle of the active capture backend
//!   (`Stopped/Starting/Running/Error` × `kind: Mitm | Chromium`).
//!   Producer: `ipc::commands` / capture supervisor. Consumer: `ipc`
//!   forwarder.
//! - [`NotifyBus`]: ad-hoc toast notifications. Any subsystem may push;
//!   `ipc` forwards to the frontend as `notify` events.
//!
//! Channel capacity is fixed-size — slow consumers see `RecvError::Lagged`
//! rather than blocking the producer. That's the right trade-off for a
//! real-time analyzer: if the HUD falls behind, drop and resync rather
//! than stall the proxy.
