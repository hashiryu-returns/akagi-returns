//! The always-on-top suggestion overlay ("PiP") window.
//!
//! A second webview, frameless and transparent, that floats over the game
//! client and renders the bot's top-N suggestions. It needs no backend
//! plumbing of its own: `bot-response` is already `app.emit()`-ed, which
//! broadcasts to *every* webview, so the overlay just listens for it (see
//! `frontend/src/routes/Overlay.tsx`).
//!
//! Both windows load the same `index.html`; the frontend branches on
//! `getCurrentWindow().label` to decide which root to render. That keeps the
//! window identity in one place (this module's [`LABEL`]) instead of encoding
//! it in a URL that the router would then have to parse back out.
//!
//! Lifecycle is driven entirely by `config.overlay.enabled`:
//!
//! - at startup, `lib::run` calls [`reconcile`] once;
//! - on every `update_config`, the command calls [`reconcile`] again;
//! - the overlay's own close button flips `enabled` to false, which routes
//!   back through the same path.
