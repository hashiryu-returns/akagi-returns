//! Recognizers that read meaning out of captured HTTP exchanges.
//!
//! Capture is generic: [`crate::capture::http`] records every exchange a
//! backend intercepts without understanding any of it. Understanding is
//! this layer's job, and it is strictly additive — a recognizer returns an
//! [`HttpAnnotation`] that rides along with the exchange, and knows
//! nothing about how the exchange was captured.
//!
//! That split is the whole design. Vendor vocabulary (`logstore`,
//! `log_category`, …) lives inside an annotation's `data`, never in
//! [`crate::schema::HttpExchange`]. Adding a recognizer for a new
//! analytics vendor, a new game, or a new protocol therefore touches this
//! directory and nothing else — not the schema, not the capture
//! backends, not the reader, not the UI.
//!
//! Annotations are also how Akagi describes **its own** behaviour: when
//! the proxy declines to intercept something, that decision is recorded
//! as an annotation on the CONNECT (see `akagi_bypass` in the proxy
//! handler). A blind spot that announces itself is not a blind spot.
//!
//! ## Adding a recognizer
//!
//! 1. Add a module here that inspects a [`RequestView`] and returns
//!    `Option<HttpAnnotation>`.
//! 2. Call it from [`annotate_request`].
//! 3. Give it a stable `kind` string — the UI groups and filters on it.
//!
//! Keep recognizers cheap. [`annotate_request`] runs on every intercepted
//! request, the overwhelming majority of which match nothing.
