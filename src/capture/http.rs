//! Generic HTTP capture — the policy both backends share.
//!
//! Akagi recorded WebSocket frames and threw away everything else, which
//! meant every HTTP request the game made was invisible: route topology,
//! version and CDN endpoints, and the analytics beacons through which the
//! client reports on itself. This module is the other half of that: what
//! to keep, what to skip, and how to say so.
//!
//! Nothing here understands any protocol above HTTP. Meaning is added
//! separately by [`crate::inspector::annotate`], which keeps capture
//! platform- and vendor-agnostic by construction.
//!
//! ## Bodies
//!
//! Bodies are the expensive and the risky part. Akagi forwards traffic
//! untouched; reading a body means buffering it and rebuilding the
//! message, which changes that. So a body is only ever buffered when all
//! of the following hold, and the decision is made from headers alone —
//! before a single byte is read:
//!
//! - capture is enabled and body capture is on,
//! - `content-length` is present (so streaming and chunked responses are
//!   never held up waiting for an end that may not come),
//! - it is within [`HttpCapturePolicy::max_body_bytes`],
//! - the `content-type` is textual.
//!
//! Anything else is recorded with the reason it was skipped rather than
//! being silently absent — a timeline that looks the same whether a body
//! was empty or merely dropped is exactly the blind spot this module
//! exists to remove.
//!
//! ## Pairing
//!
//! `hudsucker`'s `HttpContext` carries only the client's socket address —
//! no request identifier. Over HTTP/1.x that is enough: one request is in
//! flight per connection at a time, so a FIFO queue per client address
//! pairs a response with its request exactly. Over HTTP/2 it is not —
//! many streams share one connection and responses may interleave — so
//! [`ExchangePairing::close`] refuses to guess and the response is
//! recorded unpaired. The chromium backend has no such problem; CDP hands
//! out a real request id.
//!
//! **Only queue a request that will actually produce a response here.**
//! hudsucker answers a `CONNECT` from `process_connect`, a WebSocket
//! upgrade from `upgrade_websocket`, and a failed forward from
//! `handle_error` — none of which call the response hook. Queueing one of
//! those leaves an entry nothing ever claims, and every later response on
//! that connection is attributed to the request before it. A live capture
//! caught exactly that: JSON responses recorded as `CONNECT`, which has no
//! body at all. The proxy handler decides what may be queued; see
//! `will_be_answered_by_handle_response` there.
