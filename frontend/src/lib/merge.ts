// Three-way merge for "draft being edited in the UI" vs "config changed
// externally".
//
// Both the Bots page's cloud-inference card and the Setup wizard hold an
// editable draft seeded from the stored config. The stored config can change
// underneath them while the draft is open — most notably when a purchased API
// key finishes delivery with the purchase dialog unmounted and the purchase
// store persists `bot.api` directly. Blindly re-seeding the draft would wipe
// the user's unsaved edits; ignoring the change would leave a stale draft
// whose Save silently reverts the externally-written values (e.g. a paid key).
//
// `mergeExternal(draft, prevStored, nextStored)` resolves this per field:
// - fields the user did NOT touch (draft still equals `prevStored`, the
//   stored snapshot the draft was last synced against) adopt the new stored
//   value;
// - fields the user DID edit keep their draft value, even when the stored
//   value moved too — the in-progress edit wins the conflict;
// - plain objects are merged recursively, so nested sections (e.g. `bot.api`)
//   merge field-by-field instead of all-or-nothing.
//
// Values are compared structurally (via JSON), which is exact for config
// shapes (primitives, arrays, plain objects). Arrays are treated as leaves.
